## Motivation

The goal of this project is to propose a Shiny App that provides movie recommendations based on the users tastes. 

We are motivated by the fact that during these hard times in which self isolation is imposed, access to quality movies is of particular importance. Furthermore, looking for movies on websites such as IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes only offer limited abilities. For instance, it is not always possible to combine different filtering options (i.e year, genre and ratings) and it does not provide selection based on our tastes. Moreover, it would be useful to benefit from the knowledge of other users, especially the ones with an extensive movie culture/knowledge that have the similar tastes as us. Lastly, understanding the mechanism of recommendation tools could be useful since such tools are used in many potential future business related situations (i.e if managing an online sales platform).

# Documentation on the package MovieScrapR

The package [MovieScrapR](https://github.com/ptds2020/MovieScrapR) has been developed in the context of the course "Programming tools in data science" at HEC Lausanne.

The aim of this package is to facilitate the scrapping of informations and ratings of movies on [MUBI](https://mubi.com/). Moreover, we developped a shiny application that provides recommendation based on the scrapping tools developed.

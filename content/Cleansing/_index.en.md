Since the average ratings of a movie can be greatly affected by a single review when its total number of ratings is low, we decide to discard the movies with less than 40 reviews.

Consecutively, we decide to remove ratings from users that gave less than 40 ratings. This allow us to keep more "precise" ratings as we can reasonably assume that the users who rate movies frequently have a richer cinematographic culture and thus are move susceptible to give more relevant ratings.

```
# Remove movies with less than 40 reviews
ratings_clean <- ratings %>% 
  group_by(url) %>%
  filter(n() >= 40) %>%
  ungroup()

# Remove user IDS with less than 40 reviews 
ratings_clean <- ratings_clean %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  filter(n() >= 40) %>%
  ungroup()
```

### Movie Information

Once the rating Data Frame is cleaned, we may proceed to the movie information gathering. This is accomplished once again thanks to the MovieScrapR package and its function scrape_info. Note that this operation may take a significant amount of time.

```
urls_for_info <- unique(ratings_clean$url)

info <- scrape_info(urls_for_info)
```

The resulting data frame is of the following form :
